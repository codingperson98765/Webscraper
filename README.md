# WebScraper
Text based web scraper Using Python 3

My motivation for building this project was to make it easier for me to identify which computer parts(graphics cards, motherboards, etc) were in stock at specific stores. I wanted to buy a graphics card so I could complete my new pc build but was finding it difficult to find any in stock.  
This project was built during my first year of university(Bsc, Computer Science) as I learned the basics of python.
The programs function is to make it easier to search for items in stock at the companies of Staples, Visions, Memory Express, The Source, NewEgg, and Microcenter. It asks users for input on the item and the website they would like to search on, then parses the html on the site and retrieves information regarding if it is in stock, the price, and the product name and displays this information to the user. 
In this project I learned a lot regarding how to use selenium to access websites through my code, I learned how to use the BeautifulSoup library to speed up the process of finding the product details. I also learned how to organize my code and apply OOP and the other coding procedures we were taught in class.
If I were to continue on this project i would like it to run as a bot continuously analyzing these sites to identify items that are in stock and immedietly notifying me through a text that the product is available. To do this i would need to learn how to use the sites api's such as those Best Buy provides to track product information, furthermore I would need to learn how to integrate Twilio to send mobile texts.
